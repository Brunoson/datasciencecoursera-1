Report
======
You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG

```{r}
aggregate(mpg ~ am, data=mtcars, mean)
```

Quantifying how different is the MPG between automatic and manual transmissions?

```{r}
pairs(mtcars,panel=panel.smooth)
fit<-lm(mpg ~ am, data=mtcars)
summary(fit)
```
